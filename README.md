🚀 **Features:**
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration with password hashing.
- **Student Management:** Add, update, and delete student records.
- **Exam Management:** Assign exams, manage exam details, and view results.
- **Department Management:** Manage departments and sections within the school.
- **Data Validation:** Ensure data integrity with basic validation checks.
- **AJAX Requests:** Update exam marks asynchronously without reloading the page.
- **Email Notifications:** Send emails to multiple recipients for notifications and reminders.
